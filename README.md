Project Report: Stock Price Prediction App
Introduction:
The Stock Price Prediction App is designed to predict stock prices based on historical data using a Linear Regression model. The app allows users to input stock data values and obtain predictions from the trained model. It includes visualizations to evaluate the model's performance and visualize user predictions.

Code Overview:
The code utilizes Streamlit for creating the interactive web application.
It loads historical stock price data from a CSV file and displays it in the app.
The data is prepared for training by selecting features and target variable, splitting it into training and testing sets, and training a Linear Regression model.
Model evaluation is performed by calculating the R^2 score and visualizing the actual vs. predicted stock prices using Plotly.
Users can input stock values for predictions, which are then used to make predictions with the trained model.
Features Implemented:
Model Evaluation Tab:

Visualization of actual vs. predicted stock prices.
Residual plot to analyze prediction errors.
Distribution plot to compare the distribution of actual and predicted stock prices.
User Prediction Tab:

Ability for users to input stock values for personalized predictions.
Feature importance visualization for user predictions.
Confidence interval plot around user's predicted stock price.
Future Enhancements:
Incorporating more advanced machine learning models for prediction.
Adding more interactive features like date selection for historical data visualization.
Implementing real-time data updates and predictions.
Enhancing the user interface with better styling and layout.
Conclusion:
The Stock Price Prediction App provides a user-friendly interface for predicting stock prices based on historical data. The app not only serves as a tool for making predictions but also educates users on the process of model evaluation and personalized predictions. With further enhancements and refinements, this app has the potential to be a valuable resource for investors and stock market enthusiasts.
